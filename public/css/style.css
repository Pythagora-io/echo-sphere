/* Tailwind CSS Custom Styles */

/* You might want to add custom styles here that are specific to your application's design requirements. 
   This could include styles for custom components that aren't directly covered by Tailwind's utility classes. 
   Remember, Tailwind encourages a utility-first approach, so try to use its utility classes wherever possible 
   before adding custom styles here. */
